Cancer Dynamics: Position-Specific Mutant Interactions in TP53

Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are essential to numerous cellular processes and often disrupted in cancer by mutations in key regulatory proteins such as TP53. TP53, encoding the p53 protein, is one of the most frequently mutated genes in various cancers, with most mutations occurring as missense variants that compromise its tumor-suppressive functions. This study employs protein covariation analysis to infer how mutations in p53 alter PPIs, combined with AI-based structural prediction tools like AlphaFold3 to provide detailed insight into the mutation-driven changes at specific residues. We found that mutations at key interaction interfaces with proteins such as MDM2 and MDM4, particularly within the p53 transactivation domain, were predicted to interfere with known binding dynamics. We also prioritized mutations most likely to drive altered PPIs and cancer-related pathways. These findings provide a basis for developing therapeutic strategies to restore wild-type p53 function or target the oncogenic activities of mutant p53, offering potential advancements in cancer treatment.
